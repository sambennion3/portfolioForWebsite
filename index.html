<h1>Welcome to Sam's site</h1>

<hr>


<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
    I am Sam Bennion. I am a student a BYU studying computer science with a minor in business. 
    I am hopeful to break into Product Management and then go on to get an MBA.
    This past year has been difficult but I am happy to be here! I love this class, I just don't like on demand. I also enjoy playing sports, 
    listening to music, being a sneakerhead, and spending time with loved ones.
    Great family and friends have been my support system throughout the past year. I am grateful for them all.

<h2>Projects worked on</h2>

    <ol>I tried to create a chrome extension with python that blocked certain websites
         at certain times of day so I could keep more on task when trying to do school.</ol>
    <ol>I created a website in IS120 (intro to web development) an information systems class.
        I really enjoyed it and I learned a lot about css. My website is <a href="https://sambennion.com">here</a> if you want to take a look.

    </ol>
    <ol>I have worked on a lot of business type of projects as I was planning on majoring in business. One in particular was a project mapping out a user process
        for a merchant portal for Route, a tech company in Lehi. I loved walking through the user journey and figuring out how to improve the details of the user experience.
    </ol>
